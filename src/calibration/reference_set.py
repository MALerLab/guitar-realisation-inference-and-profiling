"""Reference passages: how Jae plays a passage, the answer key the cost knobs are fitted to.

One JSON file per annotation (format grip_reference_passage): where the passage comes from (the
same source fields as an optimiser run), a snapshot of the passage's notes, and how Jae plays it.
Several equally good ways to play one passage = several files with the same source; the fitter
groups them by source, not by name. Per note, the annotation gives:
- string + fret: required for every playable note (null for a null symbol)
- finger: 0 = open, 1–4 = index … pinky, null = don't care
- stroke: "down", "up", "none" (no pick: hammer-on, pull-off, slide, tap), null = don't care

Also builds the draft an annotation starts from when it starts from the source tab: the tab's
own string, fret, finger and pick-stroke marks. This is the reference side only; the source
tab's fingering still never enters generation.

Imports src/optimiser/, never the reverse.
