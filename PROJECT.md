# PROJECT.md — guitar-realisation-inference-and-profiling (GRIP)
<!-- Stable project facts for any coding agent. Claude Code reads this via CLAUDE.md,
     Codex via AGENTS.md. Agent-specific behaviour lives in those files, not here. -->

## What belongs here vs Notion
- **Here:** what a coding agent would get wrong without it — environment, folder rules,
  code vocabulary, invariants the code must enforce, data locations, verified gotchas.
- **Notion:** the why and the what-next — project definition, reasoning, roadmap/status,
  decisions + options considered, results, survey.
- **Overlap:** state the rule here in one line + a Notion link; the reasoning lives in Notion.
- **Conflict:** Notion wins on plan; this file wins on repo facts (checked against code).
  - Exception: optimiser requirements. `docs/optimiser_requirements.md` wins; Notion mirrors it.
- **Bloat:** long detail → `docs/*.md`, linked from here.

## Notion
- Hub: **guitar-realisation-inference-and-profiling** — `3e3cb37787438058920dfb43c0fed996`
- **Project Definition** — `3e2cb3778743805695c9f06c05097979`
- Read the hub before any planning or status work.

## Environment
- `uv` project, Python 3.11. Never `pip install`.
- Node side (alphaTab, for `src/data/gp_parser.py`): after `uv sync`, run `uv run npm ci` once per
  clone. `node_modules/` is untracked; `package-lock.json` pins alphaTab.

## Worktree setup
- New worktree → `./setup_worktree.sh`: submodules, `.venv`, `node_modules/`, and links to
  untracked files kept in `~/storage/grip/` (the storage root).
- Untracked but needed file → store it under `~/storage/grip/`, add one `link` line to the script.

## Git remotes
- One remote, `origin`: fetch from one URL, push to two. Both repos are **public**.
  - fetch: `git@github.com:jae-gye/guitar-realisation-inference-and-profiling.git`
  - push: the same URL + `git@github.com:MALerLab/guitar-realisation-inference-and-profiling.git`
- One `git push` updates both; there is no separate MALerLab remote to fetch from.
- Check: `git remote -v` → 1 fetch line, 2 push lines.

## Layout rules
- `src/` subpackages: `data/` · `realisation/` (the optimiser; `uv run python -m src.realisation.run_optimiser <lick.yaml>`) · `technique/` · `evaluation/` · `gp_viewer/`
  (dev tool: browse GP files in a browser; `uv run python -m src.gp_viewer.server`).
- `configs/<subpackage>/` mirrors `src/<subpackage>/` — no hardcoded parameters in `src/`.
  `configs/experiments/` is added when the first experiment exists.
- `scripts/` = one-off / temporary, **untracked**. May hardcode values; its settings never
  enter `configs/`. Used twice or proven useful → review and promote to `src/`.
- `manifests/*.parquet` = **indexes only** — ids, paths, splits, metadata, counts. Never
  musical content (notes, string/fret, techniques). Files live in `~/storage/grip/manifests/`,
  untracked, linked into `manifests/` by `setup_worktree.sh`; the builder code + config
  are tracked, so any manifest can be rebuilt. CSV only on demand, never tracked.
- **Derived datasets** = anything holding musical content → `~/storage/...`, untracked.
  The repo is public: nothing from DadaGP / mySongBook may be committed.
- `data/` = symlinks to `~/storage/...`, untracked.
- `externals/<category>/<repo>` = reused repos as git submodules, pinned to release tags,
  read/reference only, unmodified (e.g. `externals/parsers/PyGuitarPro`). Large repos are
  shallow (`shallow = true` in `.gitmodules`). Clone with `--recurse-submodules`.
- `experiments/`: `exp<NNN>_<YYMMDD>_<rest>`.

## Vocabulary (one word per concept, in code and docs)
- **realisation** — one fingering (string + fret per note, possibly finger / hand position) plus
  its **pick plan** (stroke per note: down, up, or none for a hammer-on / pull-off) for a fixed
  pitch + timing passage. Both are chosen in one search.
- **string numbers** — strings are named 1–6 (7 on a 7-string), 1 = highest-pitched (thin e),
  as in GP and `gp_parser.py`. Never letter names (e/B/G…) in code, docs or chat.
- **technique compatibility** — which techniques a realisation supports.
- **reference coverage** — does the candidate set contain the trusted human realisation,
  or something materially similar?
- **technique coverage** — does ≥1 plausible candidate preserve the withheld technique?

## Invariants
- Generate → freeze candidates → analyse techniques. Full list: `docs/optimiser_requirements.md`.
  - Generation prices the fretting hand and the picking hand with equal weight (pick direction,
    string crossings, legato where it changes playability).
  - No technique favouritism: generation never drops or ranks down a realisation for suiting
    one technique badly. Technique compatibility is computed after generation.
  - `src/realisation/` never imports from `src/technique/` or `src/evaluation/`.
  - The source tab's fingering and pickstroke marks never enter generation; its articulation
    marks (bends, hammer-ons…) enter only where switched to enforced (R1); compatibility scores
    never steer generation.
- Source fingering = evidence, not target. Reference coverage is not the evaluation target.
- Missing annotation ≠ negative label (incl. absent DadaGP technique tokens).
- mySongBook data is never redistributed.

## Data on disk
_(empty until data arrives)_

## Gotchas
_(verified facts only)_
- **DadaGP tokens rewrite drop tunings** (`downtune:0`, low-string frets −2, negative frets) →
  read the original gp3/gp4/gp5, never `.tokens.txt` or the `.gp2tokens2gp.gp5` re-saves.
- **DadaGP index JSONs** differ from disk by folder-name case for 32 songs (Mac-built) → key on disk paths.
- **File extension lies** for 63 DadaGP files (60 `.gp3` are GP4 inside, 3 the reverse) →
  use `detect_gp_format`, which reads the bytes.
- **alphaTab decodes text as UTF-8 by default**, destroying non-Latin gp3–5 track names into `�`
  → pass `windows-1252` (keeps every byte; Cyrillic/Hebrew re-readable via cp1251/cp1255).
- **alphaTab refuses bars with >100 beats** (`Gp3To5Importer._maxBeatCount`): 7 DadaGP songs fail,
  plus 1 alphaTab `TypeError`; PyGuitarPro reads all 8. Listed in the songs manifest's `parse_error`.
  Affects `gp_parser.py` too.
- **gp3–5 give every non-drum track a tuning** (default 6 strings, incl. harp, choir, piano) →
  string count is no evidence of guitar. The format holds at most 7 strings.
- **MIDI program ≠ instrument**: ~260 named guitars sit on non-guitar programs, ~35 bass parts on
  guitar programs → guitar/bass rules in `configs/data/build_dadagp_manifest_v*.yaml`.
- **DadaGP "leads" token group** = MIDI-program catch-all for non-guitar melody instruments
  (piano, strings, brass, synth leads); includes the mislabelled guitars above.
