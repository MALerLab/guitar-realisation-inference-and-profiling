# Optimiser design log

Decisions for building GRIP's two-hand optimiser, made with Jae one topic at a time.
Requirements (what the optimiser must do): `docs/optimiser_requirements.md`. This file records
*how* we build it. Requirements win over this log in a conflict.

- Notion: updated once per finished build chunk, not per decision.
- Every finished build records **full intention vs current version's limitation** for each
  stopgap (e.g. phrase starts: Layer 1 uses rests as a proxy; intention = real phrase finding).
- Newest topic last. Each entry: date, decision, reason in one line.

## Guiding principle
- The optimiser does what an experienced guitarist would do when learning a passage by ear:
  they hear pitch + timing (timbre aside), hold a known guitar, and find one or more ways to
  play it. Nothing about how the tab says to play it.

## Build outline (planning order)
1. Input contract
2. Candidate positions (string, fret per note; max fret; neck geometry in mm)
3. Search skeleton (one joint search over both hands)
4. Fretting-hand state
5. Picking-hand state
6. Cost framework (terms, per-term breakdown, hard vs soft)
7. Fretting-hand cost terms
8. Picking-hand cost terms
9. Timing
10. Making many candidates
11. The "meaningful" filter
12. Test phrases + smoke tests

## 1. Input contract (2026-10-04)
- **R1 reworded** (applied in the requirements doc; Notion mirror syncs with the chunk update): "Input: monophonic note sequence
  (pitch + onset + duration per note), the tempo, and the instrument setup (R11). Nothing about
  how the source tab plays it enters generation: no fingering, technique marks or pickstroke
  marks."
  - Why: the old wording ("nothing else from the source tab") literally banned tempo and tuning,
    which R4 and R11 need.
- **Note record:** MIDI pitch, onset + duration in seconds; source ticks kept for tracing.
  - Tied notes arrive merged (parser `tied_notes: merge`) → a tie never asks for a new stroke.
- **Tempo, v1:** read the song's starting tempo from the GP file; manual override for
  hand-typed test phrases.
  - Future: follow tempo changes when the tab contains them.
- **Chords, double-stops, dead notes, v1:** each becomes a non-descript **null symbol** in the
  sequence, with the same onset + duration as what it replaces.
  - Neither hand is priced on it; both hands carry their state across it unchanged (like a rest).
  - The output marks it as a gap, so nothing is dropped silently (R8).
  - Why: refusing the whole passage would discard a solo over one double-stop; the null symbol
    is also where real chord support plugs in later.
  - Known cost: the hands cross it for free, so the cost around it is slightly too cheap.
  - Future build: chords / simultaneous notes and dead notes (picked, no pitch) get real support.

## 2. Candidate positions (2026-10-04)
- **No pruning:** every physically existing (string, fret) that sounds the pitch is a candidate,
  open strings included. Nothing is impossible by assumption (R8).
  - A note no string can reach is reported, never dropped or octave-shifted.
  - Later, maybe: explicit ground rules banning specific patterns — each one approved by Jae.
  - Jae's worry: compute time from keeping everything → answered in topic 3 (search skeleton).
- **Highest fret:** config value, default 24.
  - Why: a low default turns playable notes "impossible"; extra high candidates are ruled by cost.
- **Scale length:** config value, default 648 mm (25.5").
- **String spacing across the neck (mm):** left out; distance across = number of strings apart.
  Can return if a cost term needs it.
  - Jae (15+ years playing): never noticed spacing; what's playable on one electric is
    playable on others. His 7-string measures ≈ 41 mm at the nut, 60+ mm at the bridge
    (≈ 6.8 → 10 mm per gap, even across strings).
- **Instrument setup** = one object: per-string tuning, string count (6 or 7), highest fret,
  scale length. From the GP file or set by hand.

- **Guitar built for:** standard (single scale length). Fanned frets (per-string scale length)
  = future config option, low priority.

## 3. Search shape (2026-10-04)
- Jae: a guitarist thinks phrase by phrase, not note by note. A search that only judges
  neighbouring note pairs doesn't match that.
- Deferred into this discussion: search algorithm, where history lives, phrase handling.
- **Speed tooling:** plain Python + numpy first; numba only if a measured run is too slow.
- **Jae's account of learning by ear** (2026-10-04; simulated on random songs named by his wife).
  - Caveats: for guitar-idiomatic music the choice is mostly instinctive ("that lick is played
    like this"). This account is based on non-guitar vocabulary (Lingus keyboard solo, Moanin'
    sax solo, Solfeggietto on harpsichord), where he has to plan consciously.
  - Phrase first: decide how long the phrase is. Boundaries are usually obvious: musical lick
    structure, a set number of notes / beats / bars when the lick is long, or a repeating pattern.
  - Then where it's played, **relative to the current hand position**: at the 7th fret, he won't
    jump to the 15th for the next phrase just because it's easier there; moving costs more than
    finding a version that works near the current spot.
  - Place and exact shape are decided almost simultaneously; the shape isn't fixed when the place
    is chosen.
  - Takeaway: look ahead at least as far as the next phrase; stay put if you can.
  - Revision: sometimes the accepted plan for a phrase makes the next phrase harder → he reverts
    it so it fits the next one better. Each phrase bridges the previous and the next in hand
    positions (both hands: setting up the next one). Rare in guitar-idiomatic solos, more common
    the harder, more obscure or less guitar-ish the passage.
  - Offer: Jae can make the process more algorithmic by learning given examples guitar-in-hand.
- Note: the note-level exact search (Viterbi) is a time series: it scores whole-passage routes,
  not greedy picks. It never commits early, so Jae's "revert the previous phrase to set up the
  next" comes free with any exact search.
- **Search shapes considered:**
  - A. note-level: each step = one note, judged against the previous note only.
  - B. cut first, then solve: fixed cuts (bar lines, rests), each chunk solved whole, chunks linked.
  - C. segment-level: the search chooses cuts + where each chunk is played together; chunks
    scored whole (span, shape, pick pattern), moves between chunks scored separately. Inside a
    chunk, a small note-level search fills in string / finger / stroke.
- **Decision: target = C** (matches Jae's account). B = C with cuts only at bar lines / rests →
  built-in baseline.
- **Decision: build in two layers.**
  - Layer 1: note-level exact search (A), hand position + last stroke in the state, shift + timing
    costs. Also C's inner piece, so nothing is thrown away.
  - Experiment: Jae picks phrases (guitar-ish + un-guitar-ish, e.g. Moanin', Solfeggietto) and
    checks guitar-in-hand whether Layer 1 settles into licks, and where it doesn't.
  - Layer 2: chunk-level scoring for exactly the gaps the experiment shows.
  - Why: shift cost + timing may already produce much lick-like behaviour (shifts land on rests);
    what pairs can't see (whole-lick span, repeated shapes, whole-lick pick pattern, idiomatic
    shapes) gets designed from evidence, not guesses.
- **Layer 1 details:** costs compare this state with the previous one only; anything a cost
  needs to remember lives in the state. One search over the whole input passage.

## 4. Fretting-hand state (2026-10-04)
- **Decision: the hand position is its own choice in the state.** Each state holds: position
  (string, fret), the finger fretting it, and where the hand (wrist) sits on the neck.
  - Stretch = how far the finger is from its natural spot given the hand, in mm.
  - Shift = the hand position moving.
  - The hand can move during a rest, before the next phrase needs it.
  - Rejected: one finger per fret ("hand = fret − finger + 1"; reads a stretch as a shift).
  - Rejected: Jae's earlier "hand centre = average of recent finger positions". Jae: the hand
    doesn't lag behind the fingers, and a finger average doesn't describe where the wrist is;
    the hand-as-choice model is what he meant, better phrased.
- **Correction to the R3 example (Jae, 2026-10-04):** index 12 → pinky 18 is *not* nearly free;
  it's a real stretch for smaller hands (≈ 95 mm at 648 mm scale). The mm stretch cost covers it.
  Pinky 12 → index 18 is still far harder.
- **Phrase boundaries and shifts (Jae):** a pinky 12 → index 18 shift is costly mid-phrase but
  viable at a phrase boundary if the next phrase stays around the new position. Mostly how
  guitarists process things mentally, not physical capability. → input for Layer 2 and the
  timing topic (shifts cheaper at boundaries / rests).
- **Compute estimate:** ≈ 7 positions × 4 fingers × 25 hand positions × 3 strokes ≈ 2,100 states
  per note, ≈ 4.4 M comparisons per note. No pruning for speed; measure once it runs.

## 5. Picking-hand state (2026-10-04)
- Jae's input:
  - Leaning: down / up / none is enough to track the picking hand for the most part.
  - Pickslant / wrist angle: he thinks about it while rebuilding his technique, but not when
    normally playing.
  - Picking-hand *modes* should be tracked: hybrid picking (pick + middle / ring finger),
    right-hand tapping, right-hand harmonics (leaving the usual picking position). Taps are easy
    if the hand is already in tapping position, hard if it must switch tapping ↔ picking quickly.
- **Decision: stroke values = down / up / none / hybrid.** none = hammer-on / pull-off;
  hybrid = a middle / ring finger plucks while holding the pick ("pluck" rejected as ambiguous).
- **Decision: crossing types come from the note pair**, no extra memory: previous string +
  stroke vs current string + stroke gives sweep / inside / outside crossings and string skips.
- **Decision: pickslant / escape is never tracked.**
  - It's a player trait (makes some crossings easy for that player, e.g. 3-notes-per-string
    alternate picking), not a property of the realisation.
  - Same principle as R7 (no technique favouritism): offer every playable solution; player
    preferences re-rank the set later. Jae: this is what "technique-agnostic" originally meant.
- **Decision: picking-hand modes are all realisation options:** pick, hybrid, right-hand
  tapping, right-hand harmonics.
  - Why (Jae): leaving one out excludes the players who rely on it (e.g. hybrid picking to avoid
    string skips) — a bias, same theme as R7.
  - Tapping needs its own place on the neck (a second fretting position); switching
    tap ↔ pick costs. Right-hand harmonics change which positions sound which pitch.

- **Decision: Layer 1 = pick only** (down / up / none).
  - **Scheduled, next build chunk:** hybrid picking + right-hand tapping. State and candidate code
    keep a slot for both from day one.
  - **Parked:** right-hand harmonics and left-hand (natural) harmonics. Why (Jae): a harmonic is
    one set way of playing a specific articulation, not an alternate way of playing the notes.
- **Legato principle (R2, settled earlier):** if taking the legato away makes the passage
  harder, it's playability; otherwise it's style.

- **Jae on legato (2026-10-04, input, not yet decided):**
  - Legato is cheap compared to the picking-hand work it replaces: before a string skip, a
    legato note gives the next pick more time; a hammer-on / pull-off simplifies a complicated
    economy / sweep pattern. He uses legato for playability, almost never for style.
  - GRIP doesn't approximate the original recording, so legato is functional by default.
  - Proposal: where the source tab marks hammer-on / pull-off / bends / left-hand taps, treat the
    mark as immutable ground truth (only the neck position is free) → this reads technique marks.
  - Hammer-on from nowhere (left-hand tap): expensive, used only when no other way works, unless
    the tab marks it. Ultimate test: Tosin Abasi.
  - ⚠️ Conflicts with R1 as reworded today (no technique marks in generation) → raised with Jae.

- **Decision: articulation marks = a switch per articulation type, settable per passage.**
  - Enforced → the tab's mark is a fixed part of the music; only the neck position is free.
    Off → the mark is hidden; the articulation is decided by playability.
  - Evaluation runs hide the articulations they test; the student tool / real use enforces.
  - Jae: bends are sacred (last thing anyone turns off; a bend played as a slide isn't the same
    lick). Hammer-ons / pull-offs are usually negligible unless a strong stylistic point.
  - Applied: R1, R2, R1 + R2 + R7 details in the requirements doc; PROJECT.md invariant.
- **Decision: unenforced legato is functional**, chosen by cost where it makes the passage easier;
  ties go to picking (legato's base cost slightly above an easy pick stroke).
- **Decision: hammer-on from nowhere** (left-hand tap onto a new string / after a rest) is
  allowed, priced high, used only when nothing else works, unless enforced. Test case: Tosin
  Abasi.

- **Decision: every articulation switch defaults to enforced.**
  - Why (Jae): community tabs mark an articulation only when it's strictly or characteristically
    needed for the song, so a mark is respected. Switches exist because community tabs aren't
    always reliable.
- **Decision: bends are handled in Layer 1** (they're everywhere in solos). A bend is fretted
  below the pitch it sounds → topic 2's candidate positions must cover bent notes.
- **R2 sentence for the picking-hand modes:** applied (pick, hybrid, right-hand tapping are
  realisation options; harmonics out for now).
- **Benchmark songs** for cost tuning: `docs/benchmark_songs.md` (local file in the repo,
  gitignored).

- **Bends, as the parser gives them:** a bent note's pitch = the fretted (pressed) pitch; the
  bend is a `bend_*` tag on top. The bend-to amount isn't kept. So a bent note is placed like any
  other note; the bend doesn't change the candidate positions.
- **Decision: an open-string bend is allowed but extremely expensive** — used only when nothing
  else can produce the passage. Not a hard rule.
  - Why (Jae): it's real — *Iron Man* intro bends string 6 by pressing behind the nut — but
    letting it be cheap would turn ordinary fret-5 bends into that obscure technique.
- **Decision: bends can't be switched off until the parser keeps the bend amount** (parser to-do,
  `docs/parser_audit.md` → Parser to-dos). Bends are on by default anyway.
  - The bend amount is also needed for cost: index alone can bend a small bend, not a full one;
    larger bends need middle / ring / pinky (with support).
- **Decision: v1 articulation list** (each note carries its enforced tags; input contract field):
  - bend → the note is fretted (open string = extremely expensive, see above)
  - hammer-on / pull-off → stroke = none; same string = normal legato, a new string = hammer-on
    from nowhere (allowed, expensive). No "same string" hard rule.
  - slide → stroke = none, same string as the previous note; the hand travels with the slide
  - left-hand tap → stroke = none, any string
  - Later (ignored in v1): vibrato (needs a fretted note), let ring (overlapping notes on different
    strings), palm mute, tremolo picking, ghost notes, staccato.

## 6. Cost framework (2026-10-04 → 2026-10-05)
- Set up regardless (Jae: "sounds good", 2026-10-04):
  - Cost term = one small named function of (previous state, current state, time between the
    notes) → a number, tagged fretting hand or picking hand.
  - Every term's value stored per note pair (R10); weights in `configs/realisation/`, never in code.
- **Jae on adding up (2026-10-05, provisional):** the real question = 5 moves × 10 vs
  3 moves × 9 + one mega move, same total. "It depends" — mostly on what the mega move is
  (→ individual term costs). Usual go-to: avoid the mega move. Subject to tuning.
  - Adding up matters mainly for the **difficulty readout** (30 s of grind ≠ 3 s); in the search
    it only matters when an easier way to play the same notes exists.
  - Proposed: search uses (c) with one config knob for how much extra big moves are punished
    (1 = plain sum); the readout's adding-up is decided separately later.
  - **Decision (2026-10-05, provisional): approved as proposed.**
- **Awaiting Jae's explicit answers:**
  1. How costs add up over a passage: (a) plain sum · (b) worst moment (Hori) · (c) sum with big
     moves punished extra (e.g. squared). Question to Jae: does a passage feel hard by total
     effort or by its worst spot?
  2. Weights in Layer 1: (a) hand-set in config, tuned by Jae on the benchmark songs ·
     (b) learned from tab data (risk: ~79 % of DadaGP tabs match a lowest-fret rule → probably
     software-made, so learning may copy the software).
  3. Hard rules (R8): separate named list, checked apart from costs, reported by name, each one
     needs Jae's yes. Currently empty — confirm.

- **Decision (2026-10-05): weights are hand-set in config, tuned by Jae** against the benchmark
  songs. Not learned from tab data.
  - Why (Jae): guitar expertise is his unique contribution; manual tuning for better output.
  - Hand-made datasets (GOAT, ProgGP — both acquired 2026-10-05, probes pending) can later
    *check* the tuned weights, e.g. reference coverage, rather than set them.

- **Decision (2026-10-05): hard rules** = a separate named list, checked apart from the costs,
  reported by name when it blocks something; each rule needs Jae's yes. The list started empty;
  hard rule #1 (a new phrase starts with a downstroke) added 2026-10-05 → see Phrase starts.

## 7. Starter cost terms (2026-10-05)
- Build order chosen: starter terms → build → Jae tunes against real output (easier to judge
  with real examples: why this sucks, why that's better).
- **Every term has its own weight knob**, tweakable without changing the formula. Tune knobs
  first; change a formula only if knobs can't fix it.
- **Approved:**
  - shift (fretting hand moves, mm ÷ time available) — weight `left_shift`
  - stretch (finger reach from its natural spot under the hand, mm, every note) — weight
    `fingers_stretch`
  - legato: flat cost, not hard to play but never preferred over an easy pick; value set
    relative to the picking table below
  - hammer-on from nowhere: high flat cost, value pending
  - open-string bend: extremely high flat cost
  - adding up: each move's total raised to the knob (start 2), then summed
  - Naming: Jae's weight names; reconcile with the "fretting hand" vocabulary at build time.
- **Picking hand: replaced "pick travel distance" with a case-by-case table** (Jae: it's less
  about distance travelled than case by case). Baseline: a downstroke on one string = 1;
  same-string upstroke after a downstroke ≈ 1. Every case × a multiplier on the time since the
  last picked note. Table in discussion.

### Picking table, same string (Jae, 2026-10-05, guitar in hand)
- **S1 down → up:** the baseline.
- **S2 up → down:** baseline normally, but **starting a new phrase on an upstroke is awkward** →
  heavier cost at a phrase start. An upstroke start usually means the passage continues the
  previous phrase (matches the requirements doc's phrase-border soft hint). Jae: maybe personal,
  small precaution.
  - Layer 1 has no phrase boundaries yet → needs a proxy (e.g. first stroke after a rest) or waits
    for Layer 2.
- **S3 down → down:** costs extra. Jae's comfortable speeds: repeated downstrokes ≈ 95 bpm (higher
  possible, not sustainable); alternate picking ≈ 190 bpm. Repeated downstrokes are harder than
  alternate picking at twice the bpm — not "half speed = same effort".
  - Endurance: repeated downstrokes should drain it faster (if endurance is tracked per technique).
- **S4 up → up:** much, much higher cost. Max ≈ 84 bpm, very uncomfortable.
- Idea (from these numbers): each case could be defined by its comfortable max speed, and the
  time multiplier derived from it — cost rises as the time per stroke nears that case's limit.
  Not decided.
- bpm figures are for 16th notes (4 notes per beat).
- Top-speed idea: revisit at the end of the table. Caveat (Jae): only one player's numbers —
  a jazz guitarist may feel very different.
- Jae: "down → down or up → up are the same cost; most people would find them similarly
  difficult" (his own down → down difficulty = a bad habit he's fixing). To-do: quick online
  check later. ⚠️ Pending clarification: same-string repeats (S3 vs S4) or sweeps (A1 vs B1)?

### Picking table, neighbouring strings toward string 1 (Jae, 2026-10-05)
- Order: **A1 < A3 < A4 ≪ A2.**
- **A1 down → down (sweep):** easy; cheaper than A3. Equally proficient in both → economy is more
  ergonomic by definition. Many players may prefer alternate, but costs follow ergonomics
  (no technique favouritism).
- **A2 up → up (reverse sweep):** horrible; very costly, almost always avoided.
- **A3 down → up (outside):** easy enough; slightly more expensive than A1.
- **A4 up → down (inside):** in practice similar to A3; tagged slightly more expensive than A3 to
  stay consistent with ergonomics.
- Jae's idea: a user who prefers alternate picking states it, and A3 / A4 costs drop (and the
  A3–A4 gap shrinks). ⚠️ Must re-score the frozen set, not re-run the search (R7: preferences
  re-rank, never steer generation).
- Baseline question (Jae): make strict alternate picking the reference? → dropped; *Stratosphere*
  shows it's a bad idea. Unit stays: alternate on one string = 1.

### Picking table, clarifications + toward string 6 (Jae, 2026-10-05)
- Ambiguity resolved: one string → alternate < down → down < up → up (S1 < S3 < S4). Across
  strings → down-down sweep = up-up sweep to start (Jae personally finds the down-down sweep
  harder; forum survey later).
- **Terminology:** never "reverse sweep". A1 = **down-down sweep**, B1 = **up-up sweep**. A2 / B2 =
  a stroke going against the direction of the string change (not a sweep).
- **B1 up → up (up-up sweep):** same as A1 (survey pending).
- **B2 down → down against the string change:** very expensive, same as A2.
- ~~B3 < B4~~ → superseded by the crossing rule below (confirmed).
- **Crossing rule (Jae):** a crossing is marginally cheaper when its first stroke already moves the
  hand toward the next string.
  - Toward string 1: starting with a downstroke → A3 (down on 4 → up on 3) < A4 (up on 4 → down on 3).
  - Toward string 6: starting with an upstroke → B4 (up on 3 → down on 4) < B3 (down on 3 → up on 4).
    Flips Jae's earlier "B3 < B4" — confirmed by Jae (2026-10-05).
  - **The differences are minimal.** Setting A3 = A4 = B3 = B4 is a legitimate option for fine
    tuning.
- **Name:** A2 / B2 = **against-crossing** in code. In docs and chat, spell it out with strings
  and strokes (e.g. "up on 4 → up on 3") when verbosity isn't a problem.
- Jae doesn't use the terms "inside / outside picking" → avoid in chat.

### Picking table, string skips (Jae, 2026-10-05, guitar in hand)
- Skip 5 → 3 (toward string 1), cheapest to dearest:
  down on 5 → up on 3 < down on 5 → down on 3 < up on 5 → down on 3 < up on 5 → up on 3.
  - down → down over a skip is like down → down on one string: stop, pull back up, go down again;
    an upstroke continues from the stop instead. Real difference minimal; fine as the basis.
  - up on 5 → up on 3 (against-skip): expensive, "ew no".
- Skip 3 → 5 (toward string 6): the mirror image.
  - But against-skips differ: up on 5 → up on 3 is really awkward; down on 3 → down on 5 is
    somewhat easier → Jae finds downstrokes easier in general.
- ~~Proposed general rule: downstrokes are easier than upstrokes~~ → replaced (2026-10-05):
  **repeated downstrokes are easier than repeated upstrokes**, on one string (S3 < S4) and on
  skips (down on 3 → down on 5 < up on 5 → up on 3). **Exception:** sweeps across neighbouring
  strings, down-down = up-up.
  - Why (Jae): practice history. Repeated downpicking is drilled early; sweeps are learned in
    both directions together. One player's data → survey later.
- Longer skips are harder.
- **Streak effects (observed; need memory across several notes):**
  - down on 5 → up on 3 repeated: harder than twice the single skip.
  - 5 → 3 → 1 (skips in a row): harder still.
  - 5 → 3, then 4 → 2: the 3 → 4 neighbour move doesn't reset the load; as hard as two skips in a
    row.
  - Maybe endurance, maybe a skip-specific effect. Jae: fine to fine-tune with examples later.
- **Decision: skip model for v1** = Jae's order per pattern + extra cost per additional skipped
  string. Streak effects and endurance (physical and mental) wait for the tuning stage.

### Phrase starts (Jae, 2026-10-05, guitar in hand)
- "Downstrokes are easier" narrowed to: **a downstroke is easier to start a new phrase / pattern.**
  Not a general rule.
- Evidence: a *Stratosphere* passage — continuous 16th-note alternate picking on one string for
  several bars, **no rests**, while the fretting hand gets busy.
  - Bars 1–3: similar patterns in different places → one mental group. The alternation puts an
    upstroke at the start of each bar; awkward at first, Jae got used to it.
  - Bar 3 ends on a downstroke. Bar 4 = a different pattern → a new phrase in Jae's head. Natural
    alternation says upstroke; Jae forced a downstroke → down → down on one string at 16th speed
    → stutter.
- **Phrase boundaries can be purely mental** (pattern change, no rest) → rests can't define
  phrases; most phrase starts need Layer 2.
- **The urge to start a new phrase with a downstroke overrides natural alternation**, even at
  the price of a repeated downstroke.
- Implication: the two-hand search can escape the dilemma (awkward upstroke start vs stuttering
  down → down) by changing something earlier, e.g. a hammer-on in bar 3 skips one pick stroke so
  bar 4 lands on a downstroke. Needs the phrase-start cost to exist.
- **Upstroke to start a new phrase = very expensive** for Jae; most players probably alike (some
  may be up/down ambidextrous) → candidate toggle later.
- (Jae would normally start bars 1–3 with downstrokes too.)
- **Rests don't define phrases** unless the rest is of significant length; a small rest is often
  part of an ongoing phrase. A long rest = a strong boundary signal, not the definition.
- **Silent strokes through short rests (Jae, from a drill book; he does it naturally):** in a
  continuous 16th pattern with a 16th rest, the hand keeps alternating in the air, so the note
  after the rest repeats the stroke before it: down – rest – down, up – rest – up. Not a
  stutter. Another reason rests can't define phrases. → Record now, fine-tune later.
- **HARD RULE #1 (approved by Jae, 2026-10-05): a new phrase starts with a downstroke.**
  - Not physically impossible — fundamental to everything that follows it.
  - Config toggle, on by default; off for up/down-ambidextrous players.
  - Trigger = whenever a new phrase begins (not "after a rest").
  - Never makes a passage unplayable: a repeated downstroke is always available, and the search
    may find a legato escape earlier.
  - ⚠️ **Depends entirely on finding phrase boundaries well.** If the system can't find them as
    well as Jae would like: toggle the rule off (keeping it in the list), or learn where
    boundaries are (e.g. a neural network trained on boundaries).
- Escape route confirmed by Jae: he probably uses legato this way unconsciously. Whether other
  players struggle as much with upstroke phrase starts: survey online / ask Pedro.
- ~~At a lick boundary: soft preference for a downstroke~~ → superseded by hard rule #1.
- **Decision: Layer 1 proxy for phrase starts** = rests of at least a set length (config, start:
  1 beat). Improved gradually; real phrase finding arrives with Layer 2.
  - **Bar lines as a second proxy: own toggle, default off** → only rests are boundaries for now.
    Risk if on: pickup notes before the bar line, continuous 16ths with upstrokes on bar starts,
    odd groupings crossing bar lines.

### Starter numbers (2026-10-05)
- **Values live only in `configs/realisation/optimiser_cost_v0.1.yaml`** (one source of truth);
  first guesses following every order above; Jae tunes them once tabs are generated.
- **Decision: B2 (down on 3 → down on 4) very slightly cheaper than A2 (up on 4 → up on 3)** —
  follows the repeated-downstroke rule, and matches how it feels on the guitar.
- Config names for the cases: `alternate`, `repeated_down` / `repeated_up`, `down_down_sweep` /
  `up_up_sweep`, `first_stroke_toward_move` / `first_stroke_against_move`,
  `against_crossing_*`, `against_skip_*`, `per_extra_skipped_string`.
- `left_shift` and `fingers_stretch` are `null` until the timing topic sets their formulas.
  - **Limitation (Layer 1):** misses purely mental boundaries, like the *Stratosphere* bar-4 case.
- Re-scoring confirmed: preferences re-score the frozen set. Expected and wanted: the most
  ergonomic (often economy-heavy) version first, then an alternate-heavy version for players not
  yet comfortable with economy.

## Next
- Topics 1–6 decided. Next: starter cost terms → first build plan (topics 1–6 + starter terms →
  one cheapest two-hand realisation for a hand-typed phrase); full cost review (topics 7–9)
  with Jae against real output.
